# Hi, I'm Dev Saini

**A focused, self-driven Python learner building my foundation with discipline, not hype.**

I'm currently a 10th-grade student, but I don't let that define or limit me. Instead of chasing grades or hollow titles, I invest my time mastering real skills and solving real problems through code. I'm a proud nerd—selective, curious, and unapologetically productive. I started learning coding and skill development in the mid-9th class.

## What I'm Working On

- Learning **Python** in depth (functions, OOP, decorators, closures, etc.)
- Exploring **Git & GitHub** to document and version my work professionally.
- Skills necessary for my career (Ai, ML, etc)

## Projects I've Built So Far

Here’s a glimpse of my learning journey through projects—each one stepping up my skills, logic, and mindset:

- **SnakeWaterGun Game (Python)**  
  A classic Python game using logic and conditionals. Helped build my base in loops, conditions, and user interaction.

- **PersonalBot** & **PersonalBotTurbo**  
  Early-stage CLI-based bots using basic Python. These bots weren’t smart, but they were mine. Helped me understand how to take user input, respond through options, and structure a mini script.

- **MorseCoderDecoder**  
  Converts text into Morse code and vice versa. Taught me about dictionaries, character manipulation, and string handling.

- **Guess The Number**  
  Simple game with randomised logic. Reinforced concepts like loops, conditions, and user experience flow.

- **BakeryCounter Software**  
  A mini retail counter system built for a fictional bakery. Helped me simulate real-world billing and flow control.

### Enigma Series – My Encryption Playground

A personal mission to build a strong, evolving encryption system using Python.

- **Enigma 0.1** – Basic encryption with a hardcoded key.  
  My first-ever encryption tool, built when I had just started learning Python.

- **Enigma 1.0** – Static key upgrade.  
  Cleaned up the code and implemented better logic but still used a single static key.

- **Enigma 1.9** – Multi-file support added.  
  Introduced support for `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and plain text files. Took the system from "just code" to handling real files.

- **Enigma 2.0** – Dynamic key integration.  
  Brought in a single dynamic key to strengthen security and prevent easy decryption.

- **Enigma 3.0** – **Modular. Scalable. Serious.**  
  Fully modular encryption system with **six different keys**, advanced logic based on prime, composite, odd-even logic, and more.  
  Designed to be **maintainable, scalable**, and mimic **industry-level architecture**. My most powerful project till date—crafted over **20+ days** of disciplined development.

Each project isn’t just a code file—it’s a **milestone** in my journey of becoming a world-class software developer.


## My Goals

- Learn C, C++, AI, ML and skills which are necessary for my career
- Become a **high-level Software Engineer**
- Achieve **financial freedom** through skills and consistency
- Earn a **1 Cr/yr job** with proof of work, not just a piece of paper
- Make my **parents proud** by doing things differently—but doing them right

## My Values

- **Productive > Busy**  
- **Skill > Degree**  
- **Process > Perfection**  
- **Maturity > Popularity**  
- **Consistency > Motivation**  
- **Solo & Strong > Distracted & Dependent**

## About Me

- Non-social by choice. I believe in **focus over noise**.
- Always questioning, always learning, never settling.
- I’m not waiting for college to give me direction—I’m creating my own.
- I don’t chase followers. I chase **improvement**.
- I’m not perfect, but I’m **self-aware** and always upgrading.
