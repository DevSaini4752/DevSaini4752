# Hi, I'm Dev Saini

**A focused, self-driven Python learner building my foundation with discipline, not hype.**

I'm currently a 10th-grade student, but I don't let that define or limit me. Instead of chasing grades or hollow titles, I invest my time mastering real skills and solving real problems through code. I'm a proud nerd—selective, curious, and unapologetically productive. I started learning coding and skill development in the mid-9th class.

## What I'm Working On

- Learning **Python** in depth (functions, OOP, decorators, closures, etc.)
- Exploring **Git & GitHub** to document and version my work professionally.
- Skills necessary for my career (Ai, ML, etc)

## My Best Projects So Far

Here’s a glimpse of my learning journey through projects—each one stepping up my skills, logic, and mindset:

- **ToDoManager Productivity. Gamified**  
  A clean, no-fluff task manager with a point-based system to reward or penalise user behaviour based on task outcomes and deadlines. Smart features. Serious discipline.

- **Enigma 3.0 (Version of Enigma series)**  
  A powerful file encryption-decryption toolkit built from scratch using advanced logic rules, character analysis, and a fully modular Python architecture, inspired by wartime cipher machines, built for modern digital protection.

- **Nexus: Productivity Enigne** (Under devlopment)  
   A powerhouse ecosystem combining task tracking, personalised news, weather updates, stock and currency data, smart emails news, and a user account system - all stitched together into a seamless python driven suite.

### Enigma Series – My Encryption Playground (My all time best so far)

A personal mission to build a strong, evolving encryption system using Python.

- **Enigma 0.1** – Basic encryption with a hardcoded key.  
  My first-ever encryption tool, built when I had just started learning Python.

- **Enigma 1.0** – Static key upgrade.  
  Cleaned up the code and implemented better logic but still used a single static key.

- **Enigma 1.9** – Multi-file support added.  
  Introduced support for `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and plain text files. Took the system from "just code" to handling real files.

- **Enigma 2.0** – Dynamic key integration.  
  Brought in a single dynamic key to strengthen security and prevent easy decryption.

- **Enigma 3.0** – **Modular. Scalable. Serious.**  
  Fully modular encryption system with **six different keys**, advanced logic based on prime, composite, odd-even logic, and more.  
  Designed to be **maintainable, scalable**, and mimic **industry-level architecture**. My most powerful project till date—crafted over **20+ days** of disciplined development.

Each project isn’t just a code file—it’s a **milestone** in my journey of becoming a world-class software developer.


## My Goals

- Learn Python, C, C++, AI, ML and skills which are necessary for my career
- Become a **high-level Software Engineer**
- Achieve **financial freedom** through skills and consistency
- Earn a **1 Cr/yr job** with proof of work, not just a piece of paper
- Make my **parents proud** by doing things differently—but doing them right

## My Values

- **Productive > Busy**  
- **Skill > Degree**  
- **Process > Perfection**  
- **Maturity > Popularity**  
- **Consistency > Motivation**  
- **Solo & Strong > Distracted & Dependent**

## About Me

- Non-social by choice. I believe in **focus over noise**.
- Always questioning, always learning, never settling.
- I’m not waiting for college to give me direction—I’m creating my own.
- I don’t chase followers. I chase **improvement**.
- I’m not perfect, but I’m **self-aware** and always upgrading.

**Let the work speak. The rest is noise.**
